### **Recommendation**

Given your preference for **open-source** and depending on your needs:

- **For monitoring and managing Elasticsearch clusters**, I recommend **Cerebro**. It is simple, lightweight, fully open-source, and provides a solid set of features for managing nodes, indices, and shards.
  
- **For data visualization and exploring search results**, **Kibana** remains the most feature-rich tool, but ElasticHQ is a great alternative if you want a completely open-source option focused more on cluster management with minimal overhead.

Choose **Cerebro** if your focus is on managing and monitoring the health of the cluster efficiently with minimal resources. Choose **ElasticHQ** if you want additional cluster details with a bit more control but still in an open-source setup.

For deploying an **Elasticsearch UI** with a Kubernetes operator, **Kibana** is the most suitable choice. Here's why:

### **Kibana with the Elasticsearch Operator**
   - **Operator Support**: The official **Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK)** operator, provided by Elastic, can deploy both Elasticsearch and Kibana seamlessly in Kubernetes environments. It manages both components as custom resources (CRDs).
   - **Documentation**: The ECK operator has extensive documentation and community support for deploying, managing, and scaling both **Elasticsearch** and **Kibana** in Kubernetes.
   - **Deployment**: Kibana can be deployed as part of the Elastic Stack using the operator. You can define Kibana instances in the same way you define Elasticsearch clusters in the operator, ensuring easy integration.

   Example Kibana CRD with ECK Operator:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kibana.k8s.elastic.co/v1
   kind: Kibana
   metadata:
     name: quickstart
     namespace: elastic-system
   spec:
     version: 7.17.0
     count: 1
     elasticsearchRef:
       name: quickstart
   ```

### **Other Tools with Kubernetes Operators**

- **ElasticHQ** and **Cerebro** don’t have official operators provided by their developers. However, you can still deploy them using Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) or Helm charts, but you would have to manage the deployment manually (e.g., scaling, monitoring, health checks).

   - **ElasticHQ**: You can use a custom **Deployment** and **Service** to run ElasticHQ in Kubernetes.
   - **Cerebro**: Similarly, Cerebro can be deployed via a custom **Deployment** or even a Helm chart, but you would need to handle the configuration and updates manually.

### **Recommendation**

- If you need **operator support** to simplify deployment, scaling, and lifecycle management, **Kibana** is the clear choice due to its integration with the **Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK)** operator.
  
- If you prefer a more lightweight solution like **ElasticHQ** or **Cerebro**, they can still be deployed in Kubernetes, but without operator-level automation, meaning manual management for scaling and updates would be required.

In Kubernetes environments, **Kibana** is the best fit when using operators.

Yes, **Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK)** is **open-source**. However, it operates under the **Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2)**, which is different from more permissive licenses like MIT or Apache 2.0.

### Key Points about **ECK and Elastic License 2.0**:
- **Open-source**: ECK is free to use, and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-on-k8s). You can download, modify, and deploy it for free.
  
- **Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2)**: While ECK is open-source, it’s governed by the ELv2, which places some restrictions. The main limitation is that you cannot provide ECK or Elastic Stack as a service to others (i.e., you cannot offer a hosted version of Elasticsearch or Kibana as a commercial service unless it’s part of Elastic's cloud offerings).

- **Features**:
  - ECK allows you to run and manage Elasticsearch, Kibana, and other Elastic Stack components in a Kubernetes cluster.
  - It automates tasks such as scaling, upgrading, and managing the lifecycle of Elasticsearch clusters in Kubernetes.

### Licensing Comparison:
- **Elastic License 2.0** is still open-source in the sense that it allows users to freely use, modify, and deploy the software for internal purposes, but it **restricts commercialization** without Elastic's involvement (i.e., reselling or providing it as a cloud service).

If you’re looking for something that can be deployed internally on Kubernetes without restriction and don’t intend to provide Elasticsearch as a service, **ECK** is a great option, and it is widely used in production environments.

Here’s a comparison between **Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK)** and **Zalando's Elasticsearch Operator (es-operator)**, both of which are used to manage Elasticsearch clusters in Kubernetes.
